# Descritpion
This project implements an EmailValidator class which allows you to check the validity of an email address according to several criteria:

- The email must contain exactly one "@" character.
- The local part (before "@") must not be empty.
- The domain part (after "@") must contain at least one dot ".".
- The email must not contain forbidden spaces or special characters outside of the allowed set.
- Validation is case-insensitive for the domain name.

# Launch the code : 
npm install
npm test
